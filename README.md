# Projects
This is meant to showcase my technical skills, methodologies, and techniques. These are just some simple ways in which I can work with data. I can apply these techniques among other to complete various data driven tasks.

A Highlight of each project

Customer Segmentation:
Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means) to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
Analyze customer data such as purchase history, demographics, and website interactions.
Present the findings by creating customer profiles and identifying key segments with specific characteristics and preferences.

Predictive Maintenance Model:
Build a predictive maintenance model using machine learning algorithms.
Analyze historical maintenance data and equipment sensor readings to identify patterns and indicators of future failures.
Develop a model that predicts when maintenance is required to prevent breakdowns or reduce downtime.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and provide insights on its potential cost-saving benefits.

Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews:
Collect a dataset of product reviews from e-commerce platforms.
Use natural language processing techniques to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews.
Classify the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral, and calculate overall sentiment scores.
Visualize the results by creating charts or word clouds to highlight common positive and negative sentiments.

Sales Analysis Dashboard:
Include key metrics such as revenue, units sold, and average order value.
Visualize the data using charts and graphs to provide insights into sales performance over time and across different product categories.

Website Analytics:
Set up website tracking using tools like Google Analytics.
Analyze the data to understand user behavior, traffic sources, popular pages, and conversion rates.
Provide insights and recommendations to improve website performance and user experience based on the analytics findings.
